# Neural style transfer using pytorch. 

## Neural style transfer is an optimization technique used to take two images—a content image and a style reference image (such as an artwork by a famous painter)—and blend them together so the output image looks like the content image, but “painted” in the style of the style reference image.

- Add your images to the "images" folder. 
- Run the cells in main.ipynb to make your own style transfers. 
- The images will be saved in "outputimages" folder. 

The code was implemented using: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/neural_style_tutorial.html
